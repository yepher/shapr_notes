# Shapr3D Notes

This is just a random selection of notes and ideas about Shapr3D. Some is a place for me to back up info that is found else where on the inter -webs and other is proof of concepts and prototypes that may get put together at some point to become a little bit useful.

None if this is probably reliable and much of it is likely even completely wrong.


## Overview

* `design_tracking` is a simple set of scripts to track Shapr3D project changes.
* `projectMonitor` is a GoLang project to just log when a file of interest changes. It should trigger the design_tracker logic at some point
* `change_history_viewer` is a wrapper around git history to make it easier to see what changed from one version to the next per project
